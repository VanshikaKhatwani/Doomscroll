    print("Psychological and Biological Impacts:\n")
    print("1. Dopamine Release:")
    print("   - Social media scrolling triggers dopamine, the 'reward' chemical.")
    print("   - Each new post or notification creates a small spike in pleasure.\n")
    print("2. Cortisol & Stress:")
    print("   - Negative news triggers cortisol, the stress hormone.")

    print("   - Trigger: Notification or boredom")

    print("1. AI algorithms curate highly engaging, emotional content to keep you online.")
    print("2. Recommendation systems amplify negative or shocking news to maximize watch time.")
